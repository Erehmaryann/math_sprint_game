# math_sprint_game

This is the creation of a MATH based game.

This project highlights the usuage of timing events as well as procedurally generating random, correct and incorrect MATH equations.

It is hosted on github pages: [Math Sprint Game](https://erehmaryann.github.io/math_sprint_game/) 

And it is fully responsive.

Thanks!
